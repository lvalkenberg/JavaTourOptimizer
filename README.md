This repository is a Java solver for the Travelling Salesman Problem ([TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)). The core solver use a branch-and-bound with the a [1-tree based Lagrangian relaxation](The Traveling-Salesman Problem and Minimum Spanning Trees) as presented by M. Held and R. M. Karp. Other algorithms and heuristics are use to speed up the search of an optimum TSP tour.
